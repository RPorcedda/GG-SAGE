# GravityGraphSAGE: Link Prediction in Directed Attributed Graphs

This repository contains the implementation and replicability material for the paper **"GravityGraphSAGE: Link Prediction in Directed Attributed Graphs"**.

## Dataset Download

To download the datasets from the Netzschleuder repository, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the root GG-SAGE folder.
2. Run the following command:
```bash
   python -m Datasets.get_netzschleuder_graphs
```

Alternatively, you can refer to the EasyNetz repository for datasets:

## Training the Model

To train the GravityGraphSAGE model, run the following command from the root GG-SAGE folder:
```bash
   python -m GG-SAGE.train
```

To train Gravity GAE/VGAE and Source/Target GAE/VGAE (re-adapted from gravity_gae_torch_geometric), follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the GG-SAGE/other_models/gravity_gae/ directory.

2. Run the training script:
```bash
   python main.py
```

## Required Dependencies
